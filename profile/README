Lichen Community Systems supports the collaborative design, use, and adaptation of cultural technologies and their associated practices. Our goal is to share systems and ways of working that contribute to greater self-determination and access to the technical means of production. We work closely with communities to teach, share expertise, investigate new practices, and build tools and systems for cultural work.
